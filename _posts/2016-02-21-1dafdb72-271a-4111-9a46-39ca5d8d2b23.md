Hello. I'm Casey and I'm a copywriter.

If that sounds eerily close to an AA intro - so be it.

It is a fitting similarity. 

When I graduated design school with the realization I was a copywriter,

a colleague confirmed that I had "the sickness."

That sickness has taken me on adventures across the country, 

concepting and writing cool, creative and strategically 

on point advertising and marketing across all mediums (give or take).

Much more to come, but for now, here's some snapshots of the sick world I inhabit.
